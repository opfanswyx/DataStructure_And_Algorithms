# Sqrt(x)
## Description
Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:
```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 8
Output: 2
```
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

## Solution
```c
int mySqrt(int x) {
    if(x == 0)
         return 0;
     long low = 1;
     long high = x;
     long mid;
     while (low < high) {
         mid = (low + high) / 2;
         if (mid == low)
             return mid;
         if (mid * mid > x)
             high = mid;
         else if (mid * mid < x)
             low = mid;
         else
             return mid;
     }

     return low;
}
```
