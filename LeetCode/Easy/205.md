# Isomorphic Strings
## Description
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```
## Solution
```c
bool isIsomorphic(char* s, char* t) {
    static int ab[256],ba[256];
    int a,b;
    
    (void)memset(ab,0,sizeof(ab));
    (void)memset(ba,0,sizeof(ba));
    do{
        a=*(unsigned char *)s++;
        b=*(unsigned char *)t++;
        if(ab[a]==0)
            ab[a]=b;
        if(ba[b]==0)
            ba[b]=a;
    }while(a!=0&&b!=0&&ab[a]==b&&ba[b]==a);
    return a==0&&b==0;
}
```
