# Sum of Two Integers
## Description
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example 1:
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1
```
## Solution
```c
int getSum(int a, int b) {
    while (b!=0){
        int c = a&b;
        a= a^b;
        b=c<<1;
    }
    return a;
}
```
