# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
## Description
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
Example 1:
```c
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```
Example 2:
```c
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself 
             according to the LCA definition.
```
## Solution
```c
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;
 * };
 */
struct TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(struct TreeNode* root, struct TreeNode* p, struct TreeNode* q) {
    if(p->val==root->val) return p;
    else if(q->val==root->val) return q;
    else if(p->val>root->val&&q->val>root->val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root->right,p,q);
    else if(p->val<root->val&&q->val<root->val) return lowestCommonAncestor(root->left,p,q);
    else return root;
}
```
