# Number of 1 Bits
## Description
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example 1:
```
Input: 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Integer 11 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011 
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 128
Output: 1
Explanation: Integer 128 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000010000000
```
## Solution
```c
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
    int res = 0;
    while(n)
    {
        if(n & 1)
            res++;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}
```
