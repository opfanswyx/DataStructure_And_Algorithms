# Path Sum
## Description
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
```
## Solution
```c
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;
 * };
 */
bool hasPathSum(struct TreeNode* root, int sum) {
    if(root==NULL) 
        return false;
    int t = sum-root->val;
    
    if(!root->left&&!root->right&&t==0) 
        return true;
    
    return hasPathSum(root->left,t)||hasPathSum(root->right,t);
}
```
