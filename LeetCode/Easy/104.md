# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
## Description
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its depth = 3.
## Solution
```c
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;
 * };
 */
int i=1;
int j=1;
int maxDepth(struct TreeNode* root) {
    if(root==NULL)
        return 0;
    int left = maxDepth(root->left);
    int right = maxDepth(root->right);

    return (left>right?left+1:right+1);
}
```
