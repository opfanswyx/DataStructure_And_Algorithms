# Happy Number
## Description
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 
```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```
## Solution
```c
int getother(int n)
{
    int temp=0;
    while(n)
    {
        temp += pow(n % 10,2);
        n /= 10;
    }
    return temp;
}
bool isHappy(int n) {
    int temp=0;
    if(n==1)
        return true;    
    while(n>6)
    {
        n=getother(n);
    }
    return n==1;
}
//Using fact all numbers in [2, 6] are not happy (and all not happy numbers end on a cycle that hits this interval)
```
